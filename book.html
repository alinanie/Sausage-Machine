<h1 id="sonnet-no.-83">Sonnet no. 83</h1>
<p><em>by William Shakespeare</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I never saw that you did painting need,<br />
And therefore to your fair no painting set,<br />
I found (or thought I found) you did exceed,<br />
That barren tender of a poet's debt:<br />
And therefore have I slept in your report,<br />
That you your self being extant well might show,<br />
How far a modern quill doth come too short,<br />
Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.<br />
This silence for my sin you did impute,<br />
Which shall be most my glory being dumb,<br />
For I impair not beauty being mute,<br />
When others would give life, and bring a tomb.<br />
There lives more life in one of your fair eyes,<br />
Than both your poets can in praise devise.</p>
